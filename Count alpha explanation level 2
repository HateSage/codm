func CountAlpha(s string) int {
Declares a function named CountAlpha
Takes one parameter: s which is a string
Returns an integer (the count)
    count := 0
Creates a variable count and initializes it to 0
This will store the number of alphabetic characters we find
    for _, char := range s {
Loops through each character in the string s
range s gives us each character one by one
_ ignores the index (we don't need it)
char holds the current character (as a rune/Unicode point)
        if (char >= 'a' && char <= 'z') || (char >= 'A' && char <= 'Z') {
Checks if the character is alphabetic:
char >= 'a' && char <= 'z' → checks if it's a lowercase letter (a-z)
char >= 'A' && char <= 'Z' → checks if it's an uppercase letter (A-Z)
|| means "OR" - true if either condition is true
            count++
If the character is alphabetic, add 1 to our count
    return count
After checking all characters, return the total count
How It Works:
Example: "Hello world"

H → alphabetic ✓ (count = 1)
e → alphabetic ✓ (count = 2)
l → alphabetic ✓ (count = 3)
l → alphabetic ✓ (count = 4)
o → alphabetic ✓ (count = 5)
space → not alphabetic ✗
w → alphabetic ✓ (count = 6)
o → alphabetic ✓ (count = 7)
r → alphabetic ✓ (count = 8)
l → alphabetic ✓ (count = 9)
d → alphabetic ✓ (count = 10)
Result: 10
