func CountChar(str string, c rune) int {
Declares a function named CountChar
Takes two parameters:
str → the string to search in
c → the character (rune) to count
Returns an integer (the count)
    count := 0
Creates a variable count and sets it to 0
This will track how many times we find the character
    for _, char := range str {
Loops through each character in the string str
range str gives us each character one at a time
_ ignores the index (position)
char holds the current character as a rune
        if char == c {
Checks if the current character equals the character we're looking for
== compares the two runes
            count++
If they match, add 1 to the count
    return count
After checking all characters, return the total count
How It Works:
Example 1: CountChar("Hello World", 'l')

H → not 'l' ✗
e → not 'l' ✗
l → matches 'l' ✓ (count = 1)
l → matches 'l' ✓ (count = 2)
o → not 'l' ✗
space → not 'l' ✗
W → not 'l' ✗
o → not 'l' ✗
r → not 'l' ✗
l → matches 'l' ✓ (count = 3)
d → not 'l' ✗
Result: 3
Example 2: CountChar("5  balloons", '5')

The string contains "5" (the digit character)
We're looking for '5' (rune character)
Loop finds: '5' → space → space → 'b' → 'a' → 'l' → 'l' → 'o' → 'o' → 'n' → 's'
First character '5' matches ✓ (count = 1)
Result: 1
Note: In the test, it shows CountChar("5  balloons", 5) returns 0 because 5 (integer) is different from '5' (character rune).

Example 3: CountChar("   ", ' ')

Three spaces in the string
Each space matches ' ' ✓
Result: 3
Why This Works for Edge Cases:
✅ Empty string → loop never runs → returns 0
✅ Character not found → no matches → returns 0
✅ Works with any character → spaces, digits, letters, symbols
